# Mobile SDK for CA Mobile API Gateway

## Version 1.6.00

**Released**: 12/21/17

## Features and Enhancements

### Improved app testing experience with device registration  
In previous versions, the SDK displayed "device already registered" errors when you installed/uninstalled apps during testing with multiple users. The errors are legitimate for production environments because the MAG server secures devices with this simple logic: only the previously-registered user or client can perform the re-registration. But this made app testing painful. 

In this release, the Mobile SDK generates a new device identifier after uninstall/reinstall, which reduces the likelihood that you'll get this error again. If you do get the error, we've provided the steps to remove the device from the MAG Manager.

- [Cordova App Testing](mas.ca.com/docs/cordova/1.6.00/guides/#app-testing)
            
### Customize requests to access APIs

Use the new iOS MASRequestBuilder method to build a custom request to access an API. Build a request programmatically using MAS.invoke and add your own parameters.

### Cordova enhancements

- **Use the Mobile SDK to invoke APIs on non-CA gateways**  
It’s a reality. You don't always have the CA API Gateway fronting all your APIs. You have other API management products already in place with APIs that are exposed directly on those products. You can now use the Mobile SDK to invoke APIs on these non-CA gateways. Extends vendor support in your APIM infrastructure.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT) to validate data recipients**  
By validating data recipients using JWT, you can add another layer of security beyond mutual SSL and OAuth. <br>**Requires**: Advanced developer experience (because feature is implemented only in the SDK).</br>

  - [Cordova Sign Requests Using JWT](mas.ca.com/docs/cordova/1.6.00/guides/#jwt-data)

- **Dynamic Client Configuration Using Enrollment URL**   
The Cordova Mobile SDK now supports managing the msso_config.json file outside of the app bundle. This feature provides another layer of security, and avoids having to reinstall the app to receive updates or when using a different MAG server. To understand the benefits, see [Dynamic Device Enrollment](https://docops.ca.com/ca-mobile-api-gateway/4-1/en/prepare-devices-and-apps-for-developers/dynamic-device-enrollment). For the new SDK initialization method, see [Start with Enrollment URL](mas.ca.com/docs/cordova/1.6.00/guides/#set-up-project-and-start-the-sdk).

**Note**: Some Mobile SDK features may depend on a specific version of CA Mobile API Gateway.

## Platform Testing 

| Platform | Supported     | Compatible                               |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| iOS      | 10.x and 11.0 | iOS 9.3.2 and above. Note: TLS 1.2 is required for iOS clients.|
| Android  | 6.0 to 8.0    | 4.4.2 and above.                         |      


## Limitations

| Issue                              | Description                              | Workaround                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Client certificate error (iOS)     | If you configured MAG to generate an HTTP 403 error, and the client certificate is configured for mutual SSL, the Apple Transport Layer determines that the certificate is bad and kills the entire transaction with the following error: `FAILED: Error Domain=NSURLErrorDomain Code=-1206 "The server “our.server.here” requires a client certificate.` | Change all HTTP status codes from 403 to another status code. |
| Proximity login with BLE (Android) | (DE258130) The message, "BLE advertisement has been found with Rssi: XXX," is displayed when BLE signal is received. Proximity login with BLE may not work on apps using the default JSON configuration. Depending on the device, you may need to increase the default range of the signal strength so devices can communicate using BLE. | (Admin) In the msso_config.json file, find the msso_ble_rssi value, and increase the range from -35 (default) to -80 or higher. You may need to play with these values. |
| Social Login (all SDKs)            | (MCT-177) The Mobile SDK authenticates only against a supported IDP using the User Management library. A social login implementation requires other identity providers. | (Admin) Customize MAG policies for other IDPs. |
